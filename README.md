# testing-practice

These are practice exercises for learning Jest, a Javascript testing framework.

Because the current version of Jest does not recognize ES6 import statements, Babel is used.

The assignment is to write tests for the following, and then make the tests pass.

1. A capitalize function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.

2. A reverseString function that takes a string and returns it reversed.

3. A calculator object that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.

4. A caesarCipher function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character "shifted".

5. An analyzeArray function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length.
